### Description: 
This project will look at box office performance for top 10 box office in the United States.  We will integrate movie production data (director, budget, actor, title, franchise, movie rating, release date) and social media mentions (twitter, youtube).  Out of those variables, we will look at which variable has the highest impact on box office performance and seek to create a predictive model.

 

### Research Approach:
1. Select top 10 movies for the year for 5 years
