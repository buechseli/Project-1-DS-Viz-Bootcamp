## Project Question: What makes a top 10 box-office movie?

### Group:  
	 * Jason Do
	 * Isabel Buechsel
	 * Grace Chan
	 * Fathi Elshibani

### Description: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project will look at box office performance for top 10 box office in the United States.  We will integrate movie production data (director, budget, actor, title, franchise, movie rating, release date) with audience socio-demographic indicators for the target audience (age, gender), weather data and social media mentions (twitter, facebook, google).  Out of those variables, we will look at which variable has the highest impact on box office performance and seek to create a predictive model.

### Predictive Model Analysis Questions:
•	Do any of the significantly correlated variables predict box-office income for top 10 movies?


* How does the number of tweets/sentiment affect box office numbers. Previous 6 months and 6 months after release?
* Disbursement between movies, how a movie gets the most market share?
* HIgher the movie budget, the higher the probability it will be succesful. Gather the top 20 high movie budget movies and then compare how well they did. 
* Movie budgets and movie actors affecting box office, higher budget for actor/actress salaries. Twitter Popularity/Mentions affect movies. E.G Brad Pitt/George Clooney/Tom Hanks in one movie, does that turn into a box office automatically?
