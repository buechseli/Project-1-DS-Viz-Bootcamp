## Project Question: What makes a top 10 box-office movie?

### Group:  
	 * Jason Do
	 * Isabel Buechsel
	 * Grace Chan
	 * Fathi Elshibani

### Description: 
This project will look at box office performance for top 10 box office in the United States.  We will integrate movie production data (director, budget, actor, title, franchise, movie rating, release date) with audience socio-demographic indicators for the target audience (age, gender), weather data and social media mentions (twitter, facebook, google).  Out of those variables, we will look at which variable has the highest impact on box office performance and seek to create a predictive model.

 

### Research Approach:
1. Select top 10 movies for the year for 5 years 
2. Extract Movie Variables
3. Integrate Social Media Variables
4. Integrate Socio-Demographic Data
5. Perform Correlation Analysis
6. Integrate Predictive Model (Regression)

### Movie Variables
•	Top 10 place
•	Share of total market share of data spent by moviegoers per year
•	Release Season
•	Budget
•	Franchise
•	Sequel
•	Legacy (Number of Movies in Sequel)
•	Genre
•	Director Name
•	Director (Number of Movies overall)
•	Actors Names
•	Actors (Number of Movies overall)
•	Number of Theaters
•	Audience Rating
•	Critic Rating
•	Production Studio
### Explore Social Media 
•	Twitter followers for Director in the year

•	Twitter followers for Actors in the year (top 2)
### Correlation Analysis Questions:
•	Is there a significant correlation between any of the above variables and the box-office income for top 10 rating for the top 10 movies?
### Predictive Model Analysis Questions:
•	Do any of the significantly correlated variables predict box-office income for top 10 movies?


* How does the number of tweets/sentiment affect box office numbers. Previous 6 months and 6 months after release?
* Disbursement between movies, how a movie gets the most market share?
* HIgher the movie budget, the higher the probability it will be succesful. Gather the top 20 high movie budget movies and then compare how well they did. 
* Movie budgets and movie actors affecting box office, higher budget for actor/actress salaries. Twitter Popularity/Mentions affect movies. E.G Brad Pitt/George Clooney/Tom Hanks in one movie, does that turn into a box office automatically?
* When is the most optimal time to release movie, which holidays are the best time to release a movie? How does weather condition affect the performance of a movie. How does limited or wide release affects the movie box office.
* How does Family ratings affect moviegoing, is it best to have the movie rated PG-13 to have the most amount of movie goers?\par
* The more movies the director produced the higher the chance of creating a box office?
* The  better the sequel the better the box office?
* High facebook likes? High box office?
